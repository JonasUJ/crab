# Crab currently comes with two modules 'std' and 'math'
# Both are work in progress
# A module can be used with the 'use' keyword

# When creating a module
# good practice is naming the modules functions the file name dot their name
# as with 'std' with the function 'std.incr'
# This is to avoid name collision

# Example of using other files

use std
use keywords/USE

# This ran the two files and any defined functions and variables
# are still available
