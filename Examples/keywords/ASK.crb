# 'ask' waits for the user to press enter
# It takes any amount of arguments
# Like 'cout', 'ask' prints all arguments joined by a space
# After printing, the user has to press enter for the script to continue. If the user wrote anything, 'ask' will return it

# Example

ask Hello World!{spc}

#> Hello World! foo bar
#> foo bar
